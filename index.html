        <h2>Where did it all go right?</h2>


        <p>
        Starting here at Codeup has helped propel me into the web-design field.
        Previous to this program, I had a vast portfolio of technical jobs
        ranging from medical (human dental, medical, and even animal medicine) to heavy engine
        diesel engines. Feeling the want and need to take the giant leap into
        the technological era, I set my sights on one thing that bridges two
        elements together attempting to co-exist; Language Barrier.

        After listening to the voice, I started asking myself where does one start?
        "Google" of course! So, straight to the internet I go. Now when I say intense
        searching, I truly mean intense. Internet searches not only lead my way to
        Codeup but also many other services that assisted with me going to school such
        as child-care for my three children, a MacOS computer (paramount hardware), and
        tuition assistance. Now that I started getting the tools ready for building this
        boat, lets get the materials.

        <h2>A coder's tale</h2>

        <p>
        The middle of this journey is where we find ourselves. Just finishing the first
        half and on to the second one. So far we have covered the basics of HTML, CSS, Jquery,
        Bootstrap, a good bit of Javascript, AJAX, JSON requests, and are starting Java.
        Along the way I have learned about front-end and back-end development, working with Node,
        utilizing GitHub for collaborating with fellow student on projects and housing my
        repositories, learning to work with IntelliJ as my IDE, loading packages, and being able
        to gather data, manipulate and send it out. Let's see how far down the rabbit hole goes.
